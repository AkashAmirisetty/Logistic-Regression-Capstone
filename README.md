# Logistic Regression Capstone 🧠📊

This project is a capstone focused on applying **Logistic Regression** to real-world datasets using Python. It showcases two case studies: a marketing dataset (`advertising.csv`) and the famous Titanic dataset (`titanic_train.csv`, `titanic_test.csv`). The objective is to demonstrate practical skills in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Logistic Regression Practice.ipynb`:
  Capstone-level project using the **Titanic Dataset** to predict passenger survival based on features like age, sex, fare, and more. 
  
  
- `Logistic Regression Project.ipynb`:  
  Hands-on logistic regression exercise using the **Advertising Dataset** to predict if a user will click on an advertisement.

- `advertising.csv`:  
  Dataset used to practice logistic regression on advertisement click prediction.

- `titanic_train.csv` & `titanic_test.csv`:  
  Training and testing datasets for the Titanic prediction challenge.

- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`:
